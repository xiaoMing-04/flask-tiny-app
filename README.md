The way you glow through my blinds in the morning<br>
It makes me feel like you missed me.<br>
Kissing my forehead to help me out of bed.<br>
Making me rub the sleepy from my eyes.<br>

Are you asking me to come out and play?<br>
Are you trusting me to wish away a rainy day?<br>
I look above. The sky is blue.<br>
It's a secret, but I trust you too.<br>

If it wasn't for you, I could sleep forever.<br>
But I'm not mad.<br>

I want breakfast.<br>
